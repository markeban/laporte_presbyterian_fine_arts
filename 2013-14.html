Stephen Zork, director
<br />
Sunday, November 3, 2013, 4:00 p.m. CST
<br />
<br />
<em>The Music of Creation</em> is the theme expressed throughout the choral concert to be presented by the Andrews University Singers under the direction of Stephen Zork. The choral program will be unwrapped with the rendering of the work &#8220;God, Your Voice Called Forth Creation&#8221; with music by John Horman and words by Mary Nelson Keithahn, commissioned to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Fine Arts Board of The Presbyterian Church of La Porte, Indiana.
<br />
<br />
The Andrews University Singers will render stirring settings by some of the most beloved living composers from North America, South America and England.  Included in the lighter fare will be the performance of several folk songs such as &#8220;Skylark&#8221; arranged by John Rutter, Stephen Foster's &#8220;Some Folks&#8221; arranged by Mark Hayes, the Brazilian samba &#8220;Aquarela do Brasil&#8221; arranged by University Singers' member Marcelo Martins, and the tender &#8220;Good Night, Dear Heart&#8221; arranged by Dan Forrest and set to the words of Mark Twain as inscribed on his daughter's tombstone. The centerpiece of the concert is the three-movement work &#8220;Gloria&#8221; by John Rutter.

Randy Horst &#8211; Goshen, Indiana (Best In Show)
<br />
Randy Horst has an MFA in Drawing from Bowling Green State University in Ohio. He has taught art at Bowling Green State University and the University of Montana Western, and is currently teaching art at Goshen College. In addition to 2-D studio courses, Randy teaches Art History and has led trips to England, France, Italy, and Spain. Randy's drawings and digital images draw inspiration from the Biblical and Christian narratives. They explore our relationship to our spiritual and physical needs and desires. They also explore the conceptual flexibility of imagery. For instance a circle can be a hole to another surface, a polka-dotted pattern, and a puncture all at the same time.

Jimmy Duke Johnston &#8211; Michigan City, Indiana (Third Place) 
<br />
"The art I practice is Drawing, Painting, and Printmaking; which are from life, not photographs. All the work is original, produced by my hands only. The concept is to create a work which will stand on its own &#8211; not paint a picture of something. My interest is in the form and color of objects and their relationships within the work, not reproducing a photographic likeness.
<br />
<br />
"The artists whose work I admire and who influence me are Matisse, Picasso, Braque, and Pollock. There are two statements, both I believe, by Kandinsky: I believe in 1) the first rule of painting is that there no rules, and 2) the subject of a painting is the painting."

Connie Kassal &#8211; Long Beach, Indiana (Second Place) 
<br />
"My exhibit contains drawings and wall mounted sculptural objects/boxes. The drawings are on Arches Oil Paper. The paper allows me to draw with pencil and then smudge the image with oil bars. I try to capture the ghost of memories shimmering across heirlooms. The sculptural objects are boxes and reverse paintings on glass, allowing a certain view through the glass to the inside. Reflected light is meant to suggest an undefined energy. I work as a part time lecturer at Purdue University North Central and have been active in the visual arts locally for three decades."

<br clear="all" />
<strong>Andrew Remillard</strong> received his bachelor's degree in Piano Performance from Wheaton College and a master's degree in Piano Performance from the De Paul University.  His teachers included William Phemister, Michael Fritsch, and Mary Sauer.  He has played extensively throughout the Midwest in solo recitals and with orchestras.  His students have completed courses in musical studies at major colleges and universities.  He is owner of ANR Piano, a piano repair and rebuilding facility in Downers Grove, Illinois.
<br /><br />
<strong>Edgar Swarthout</strong> holds bachelor's degrees in Piano Performance and Composition and a master's degree in Music Theory, all from the American Conservatory.  Among his teachers were William Browning for piano, Stella Roberts for theory, and Leo Sowerby for composition.  Although not a professional musician, he maintains his piano technique and continues to pursue his interest in the theoretical and critical aspects of music.
<br /><br />
<strong>Duo Pianists</strong>
<br />
Andrew Remillard and Edgar Swarthout first met in 2003.  On that occasion, Mr. Swarthout had engaged Mr. Remillard's piano shop to rebuild his piano.  During conversations in the course of that work and subsequently, it came apparent that both men harbored a long dormant interest in playing two-piano music.  By 2005 they had begun playing for their own enjoyment.  Initially that was enough, however the idea of playing for audiences became a significant part of their interest, and a search for performance venues began.  Their first recital took place in 2006.  Since then, they have performed at various locations in Chicago's western suburbs, including the Downers Grove Music Club, the Timber Lake Theatre in Mount Carroll, Illinois, and on numerous occasions at the La Grange, Illinois Public Library.  They continue to perform in the Chicago suburb area.
