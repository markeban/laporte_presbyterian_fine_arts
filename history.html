<h2>History of the FAB</h2>
<p>
The year 1985 marked the 300th birthday of several famous composers who have had a tremendous influence on music in the church, including Johann Sebastian Bach, Georg Friederic Handel, and Heinrich Sch&uuml;tz. In celebration of these great composers, a Birthday Bash series of events was planned by the music department of the church &#8211; Linda Lewis, Director of Music; and David Eicher, Assistant Director and Organist &#8211; with the strong support of Rev. Bill Wimberly. This series included a vocal and organ recital, a film about Bach, an ogran recital, a lecture on the Christianity of Bach and Sch&uuml;tz, a PDQ Bach concert, and a community choir. The series was such fun and great success that it resulted in the realization of a &#8220;dream&#8221; of the church to have a Fine Arts Series sponsored and held at our church.
</p>
<p>
The &#8220;dream&#8221; of a Fine Arts Board came to fruition in the spring of 1986 with charter members Joseph Smith, Louis Schumm, Linda Weigel, Marilyn Burrows, Bob Vinzant, Beverly Burmeister and ex-officio members Linda Lewis, David Eicher, and Bill Wimberly. The first 1986-87 series included Jane Snyder, organist, in a multimedia concert, the Notre Dame Chorale; and the 1st Biennial Juried Art Show. The Board encouraged submission of entries for a logo. The winner was Michael Boatright, and this logo portraying the various expressions of art has been used by the Fine Arts Board since 1987. Over 130 programs have been presented to the community since that time, all free to the public, with the series funded entirely by contributions.
