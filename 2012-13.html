<strong>Wooster Chorus, Dr. Lisa Wong - Director</strong>

The College of Wooster, Wooster, Ohio 
<br />

<br />
<br />
We are delighted to host the 50-voice Wooster Chorus. This will be the final concert in the 2013 Wooster Chorus Tour before they return home to Wooster, Ohio. In this concert tour, The Wooster Chorus explores the foundations of human existence. Our capacities for love, our perception of deep beauty, and our sensitivity to an expansive range of emotions are among the wealth of traits that define our humanity. Here, we survey a multidimensional journey from the basal toward self-transcendence in a program that includes the music of Johann Sebastian Bach, Maurice Duruflé, Samuel Barber, and Eric Whitacre.

When the evil witch Cora steals the magic yellow ribbon from the hair of her sister in sorcery, Hermione, &#8220;the pretty good&#8221;, the stage is set for a gripping drama which pits good against evil, mind against the mindless and the ridiculous against the sub-slime. The quest for the ribbon catches the imagination of the audience and snatches up an innocent bystander in the process. The audience acts as referee in this brouhaha among bozos and eventually helps to bring order out of chaos...almost. The moral of the story? Don't judge folks by what you see on the outside. It's what's inside that counts. No limit on the fun or the folks who are likely to enjoy this one. A family entertainment with actual humor for the people who drove the short folks to the theater.

Cantatas and French Romantic Gems
<br />
Carey Scheck, pianist
<br />
Sunday, October 14, 2012, 4:00 p.m. CDT
<br />
<br />
The first half of the program consists of 2 contrasting cantatas; the first a Handel Cantata from 18th century Europe. The second a distinctly 20th century American take on the Cantata by composer John Carter based on Negro Spirituals.
<br />
<br />
The second half features a pastiche of French Romantic gems by composers like Bizet (Carmen) and Poulenc and ends with a rarely performed Vocal Concerto by turn of the century Russian composer Rheinhold Gliere. There are no words and the voice in this piece is treated like any other instrument you would hear featured in a concerto exploring the extremes of the instrument and the abilities of the player, or in this case the singer. 
<br />
<br />
<img src="graphics/gartshore.jpg" style="float:left;margin-right:10px" alt="Sarah Gartshore" width="250px" height="298px" />
Canadian soprano <strong>Sarah Gartshore</strong> was recently selected as one of Symphony Magazine's emerging artists. Her performance of excerpts from Stravinsky's <EM>The Rake's Progress</EM> with the Richmond Symphony (VA) inspired the Times-Dispatch to write, &#8220;Soprano Sarah Gartshore sang the arias with strong characterization, full-bodied tone and unusually clear diction, promising some fine portrayals of Anne Trulove in future productions of this opera.&#8221;
<br />
<br />
As a Santa Fe Apprentice Artist, Ms. Gartshore made her debut with Santa Fe Opera as the First Lady in Mozart's <em>Die Zauberflöte</em> and returned for a second season to cover the roles of Fiordiligi in Mozart's <em>Così fan tutte</em> and Thalie/La Folie in Rameau's <em>Plat&eacute;e</em>. The Chicago Sun-Times praised Ms. Gartshore as &#8220;delightful&#8221; in her multiple roles as Madame Herz in Mozart's <em>Der Schauspieldirektor</em> and Tonina in Salieri's <em>Prima la Musica, poi le Parole</em> following one of her many collaborations with Jane Glover and Chicago's Music of the Baroque. Her portrayal of the desperate Magda, described by Opera Canada as &#8220;startlingly dramatic&#8221; was a highlight of Chamber Opera Chicago's recent production of Menotti's <em>The Consul</em>. 
<br />
<br />
Recent performances include a debut with the Grammy nominated Chicago Chamber Musicians singing Scarlatti's <em>Su le sponde del Tebro</em>, her Symphony Center debut with the Apollo Chorus performing Brahms' <em>Requiem</em>, Donna Anna in <em>Don Giovanni</em> with American Opera Group, Mica&euml;la in Bizet's <em>Carmen</em> with Chamber Opera Chicago, Santuzza in Mascagni's <em>Cavalleria Rusticana</em> with the Skokie Valley Symphony (IL), the title role in the Chicago premiere of Barber's <em>Vanessa</em> with Chamber Opera Chicago, Brahms' <em>Requiem</em> with the Kingston Symphony (ON), and <em>Messiah</em> with the Algoma Chamber Singers (ON). This past summer she performed the role of Lily Craven in the Southwest Michigan Symphony's production of <em>The Secret Garden</em>.
<br />
<br />
Much in demand on the concert stage, Ms. Gartshore's expansive repertoire includes performances of Dvorak's <em>Mass</em> with the International Choral Arts Festival of Jihlava in the Czech Republic, <em>Messiah</em> with the Richmond and Jacksonville Symphony Orchestras, Haydn's <em>Heiligmesse</em>, Pergolesi's <em>Stabat Mater</em> and the <em>Te Deum</em> of Delalande and Charpentier with Music of the Baroque, Brahms' <em>Requiem</em> and Mahler's Fourth Symphony with the Richmond Symphony, Mahler's Second Symphony and Verdi's Requiem with the Muncie Symphony (IN), and Countess Almaviva in a concert reading of Mozart's <em>Le nozze di Figaro</em> with the Northbrook Symphony (IL). As a nine year veteran of The Handel Week Festival of Oak Park (IL) she has performed several solo cantatas, <em>Judas Maccabaeus, Esther</em>, Fulvia in <em>Ezio</em>, and Galatea in <em>Acis and Galatea</em>.
<br />
<br />
Upcoming engagements include <em>Messiah</em> with The Canterbury Music Society, Mozart's <em>Requiem</em> with Chicago's Apollo Chorus and Ms. Gartshore will appear as a featured guest artist with the La Porte Symphony on their Holiday Pops concert.
<br />
<br />
Ms. Gartshore is also heard performing with guitarists Sergio and Odair Assad on <EM>Merry a Holiday Journey</EM>, a recently released CD of selections for Christmas by violinist Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg and friends.

<img src="graphics/scheck.jpg" style="float:left;margin-right:10px" alt="Carey Scheck" width="300px" height="225px" /><strong>Carey Scheck</strong> is an independent piano teacher of a variety of ages and levels.  After attending Valparaiso University to receive a degree in church music, Scheck attended Western Illinois University for a Masters Degree in Piano Performance.  Her collegiate teachers included Dr. Joseph Bognar and Dr. Tammie Walker.  As a student, Carey was fortunate to have experiences in accompanying, teaching lessons to individuals in an after school piano program, playing piano for the Wind Symphony and Orchestra, and teaching a piano class for undergraduate music majors.
