					The Konevets Quartet
				</strong>
				<br />
				Sunday, October 23, 2011, 4 p.m. CDT
				<p>
				<strong>
					The Konevets Quartet,
				</strong>
				  under the direction of Igor Dmitriev, was founded in 1992, by graduates of
				the St. Petersburg Music Conservatoire, Glinka Choral Academy; who sang in the
				Konevets Holy Trinity Monastery choir. Their goal was to share the rich
				Russian vocal tradition with audiences the world over and, they are dedicated
				to creating a perfect harmonious sound. Their repertoire was therefore created
				especially for this purpose, and remains such to this day.
				</p>
				<p>
				The greater part of their repertoire is Orthodox sacred music, ranging from
				chants and hymns by twentieth century composers, such as Chesnokov,
				Grechaninov, and Stravinsky, to ancient chants and hymns in original one, two,
				three-part arrangements and, in contemporary four-part arrangements; sometimes
				re-harmonized by the Quartet. Their secular concert repertoire features
				Russian and Ukrainian folk songs, dances and Imperial regimental songs and
				marches, which were forbidden during Communist times.   The third portion of
				the repertoire comprises of lyrics by Russian poets such as Pushkin and
				Lermontov, set to music by Tchaikovsky, Borodin, Taneyev and other famous composers.
				</p>
				<p>
				Konevets Quartet&#8217;s  impressive accomplishments merit worldwide
				recognition. These professional musicians have sung in all the great cathedrals
				of Russia, toured and participated in prestigious international festivals
				throughout Europe and the U.S. and their highly acclaimed recordings are on
				sale in many countries.  In 2010, the Quartet received Laureate status at the
				eminent International Choir Competition in St. Petersburg. They have toured
				extensively, with wide acclaim, throughout Europe & North America where they
				have also performed with baritone soloist Dmitri Hvorostovsky and basso
				profundo, Vladimir Miller.
				</p>
				<p>
				While concert tours are the Quartet&#8217;s main source of income, they share
				their revenue toward restoration of the Konevets Monastery and its daughter
				church in the heart of St. Petersburg.

				Russian violinist Andrey Baranov is among the leading violinist of his
				generation. He has been a Laureate of numerous international competitions
				including Indianapolis, Sendai, Unisa, Oistrach and Paganini (Moscow).
				Baranov&#8217;s interpretation of the Tchaikovsky concerto has been hailed by the
				Franken Post as &#8220;charmed with an instinct for tone color&#8221; and The Strad called
				Baranov &#8220;a natural player who makes you listen....one is struck by his sound
				and his large music-making gestures.&#8221;
				</p>
				<p>
				Since making his debut in 2005 at St. Petersburg Philharmonie Hall with Vasily
				Petrenko and the Philharmonic Orchestra, Baranov has performed on the world&#8217;s
